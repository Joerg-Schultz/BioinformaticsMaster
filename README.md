### Access rights

As we are working on a multi-user system, we want to clearly define who can do what with our files. In Linux, there are three levels of access rights - (u)ser, (g)roup and (o)thers. If you want to know to which groups you belong, type `group` on the command line. In addition, there are three things a user can do with a file - (r)ead, (w)rite and e(x)ecute. For each of the three levels, we can individually set the three things that can be done.

| (u)ser                  | (g)roup | (o)thers |
|-------------------------|---------|----------|
| (r)read(w)ritee(x)ecute | rwx     | rwx      |

If you type `ls -l` in a directory, you see the current rights for all files in the directory. To change the right, use the `chmod` command. This takes as first option the rights you want to change and as second option the file name. To grant rights use `+`, to revoke them `-`. This also works for directories.

| command               | description                                                           |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| chmod u+x fastqc      | make the file fastqc executable for the user                          |
| chmod go-r thesis.txt | only the user can read the thesis (revoke read from group and others) |
| chmod o-x results     | assuming that results is a directory: others can't cd into results    |
