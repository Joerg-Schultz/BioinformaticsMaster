# Bioinformatics Master

## Goal

This repository contains additional material for the introductory Bioinformatics course taught as part of the Master Life Sciences at the university of WÃ¼rzburg. In this course, you will identify genes which are up-regulated in a digesting Venus Flytrap Trap and characterize their function and evolution. To reach this goal, you will learn how to work on a remote linux machine and apply a typical RNASeq workflow. We will use RNASeq data from [Bemm et al.](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/26/6/812.full.html) and the genome published in [Palvalfi et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982220305674)
